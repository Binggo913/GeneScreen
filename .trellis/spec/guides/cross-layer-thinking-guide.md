# Cross-Layer Thinking Guide

> **Purpose**: Think through data flow across layers before implementing.

---

## The Problem

**Most bugs happen at layer boundaries**, not within layers.

Common cross-layer bugs:
- API returns format A, frontend expects format B
- Database stores X, service transforms to Y, but loses data
- Multiple layers implement the same logic differently

---

## Before Implementing Cross-Layer Features

### Step 1: Map the Data Flow

Draw out how data moves:

```
Source → Transform → Store → Retrieve → Transform → Display
```

For each arrow, ask:
- What format is the data in?
- What could go wrong?
- Who is responsible for validation?

### Step 2: Identify Boundaries

| Boundary | Common Issues |
|----------|---------------|
| API ↔ Service | Type mismatches, missing fields |
| Service ↔ Database | Format conversions, null handling |
| Backend ↔ Frontend | Serialization, date formats |
| Component ↔ Component | Props shape changes |

### Step 3: Define Contracts

For each boundary:
- What is the exact input format?
- What is the exact output format?
- What errors can occur?

## Common Cross-Layer Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Implicit Format Assumptions

**Bad**: Assuming date format without checking

**Good**: Explicit format conversion at boundaries

### Mistake 2: Scattered Validation

**Bad**: Validating the same thing in multiple layers

**Good**: Validate once at the entry point

### Mistake 3: Leaky Abstractions

**Bad**: Component knows about database schema

**Good**: Each layer only knows its neighbors

### Mistake 4: Generated Assets Without Display Contracts

**Bad**: Backend generates visual assets and the frontend infers display
semantics from incidental SVG layout or text labels.

**Good**: When a backend-generated report asset is interactive, persist the
display contract beside the asset data. For GeneScreen multi-query LINKVIEW
reports, the data payload must include the SVG asset key, actual rendered track
order, track aliases, track ranges, and marker metadata. The frontend should use
the asset key to load the SVG and the rendered order to align overlay controls,
track labels, start/end labels, gene brackets, hover lines, and tooltips.

## Checklist for Cross-Layer Features

Before implementation:
- [ ] Mapped the complete data flow
- [ ] Identified all layer boundaries
- [ ] Defined format at each boundary
- [ ] Decided where validation happens

After implementation:
- [ ] Tested with edge cases (null, empty, invalid)
- [ ] Verified error handling at each boundary
- [ ] Checked data survives round-trip
- [ ] For generated interactive visual reports, verified that backend asset
      metadata and frontend overlay state stay aligned after resize, candidate
      switch, zoom view, and drag reorder.

## When to Create Flow Documentation

Create detailed flow docs when:
- Feature spans 3+ layers
- Multiple teams are involved
- Data format is complex
- Feature has caused bugs before
